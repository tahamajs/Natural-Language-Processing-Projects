    "2. **Subword-based**: Would split words into meaningful subword units\n",
    "   - Example: \"unhappiness\" → ['un', 'happiness'] or ['un', 'happi', 'ness']\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Word-based**: Splits text into complete words (this is our case)\n",

    "### BERT and GPT Tokenizer Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Both **BERT** and **GPT** use **Subword-based Tokenization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Subword-based?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character-based tokenization:**\n",
    "- ❌ Too granular, loses semantic meaning\n",
    "- ❌ Very long sequences (high computational cost)\n",
    "- ❌ Difficult to learn meaningful representations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word-based tokenization:**\n",
    "- ❌ Huge vocabulary size (millions of words)\n",
    "- ❌ Cannot handle OOV (out-of-vocabulary) words\n",
    "- ❌ Poor morphological understanding (e.g., \"run\", \"running\", \"runner\" are completely separate)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subword-based tokenization:** ✓\n",
    "- ✓ **Balanced vocabulary size** (typically 30K-50K tokens)\n",
    "- ✓ **No OOV problem** - can represent any word by combining subwords\n",
    "- ✓ **Morphological awareness** - related words share subword tokens\n",
    "- ✓ **Efficient for rare words** - breaks them into known components\n",
    "- ✓ **Language-agnostic** - works for multiple languages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Large Language Models Need Subword Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vocabulary Management**: Keeping vocabulary size manageable (~32K tokens) while covering vast language diversity\n",
    "2. **Rare Word Handling**: Rare technical terms, names, compounds can be represented through subword composition\n",
    "3. **Morphological Generalization**: Model can understand \"unhappiness\" from \"un-\", \"happi\", \"-ness\"\n",
    "4. **Cross-lingual Transfer**: Subwords enable better transfer across languages (e.g., cognates)\n",

    "## Part 5: Theoretical Question - Can We Increase N Indefinitely?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question: Can we increase n in n-gram models without limit? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: No, we cannot increase n indefinitely.** Here are the key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Data Sparsity Problem** \n",
    "\n",
    "As n increases, the number of possible n-grams grows **exponentially**:\n",
    "- Vocabulary size: V\n",
    "- Possible bigrams: V²\n",
    "- Possible trigrams: V³\n",
    "- Possible n-grams: Vⁿ\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** With vocabulary V=10,000:\n",
    "- Bigrams: 10,000² = 100 million possible\n",
    "- Trigrams: 10,000³ = 1 trillion possible\n",
    "- 5-grams: 10,000⁵ = 10²⁰ possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these n-grams will **never appear in any corpus**, no matter how large. This leads to:\n",
    "- Zero probabilities for unseen n-grams\n",
    "- Poor generalization\n",
    "- Unreliable probability estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Memory Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing all n-grams and their counts requires:\n",
    "- **Space: O(Vⁿ)** in worst case\n",
    "- For n=5, V=50K: ~3×10²³ possible 5-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with sparse storage (only seen n-grams), memory grows rapidly:\n",
    "- Bigram model: ~GB scale\n",
    "- 5-gram model: ~TB scale\n",
    "- 10-gram model: Not practical\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Computational Cost**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training time**: Must count all n-grams in corpus: O(L × n) where L is corpus length\n",
    "- **Inference time**: Must lookup n-gram probabilities: O(n)\n",
    "- As n increases, both training and inference become prohibitively expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Statistical Reliability**\n",
    "\n",
    "For reliable probability estimates, each n-gram needs to appear **multiple times** in training data:\n",
    "- Rule of thumb: Need at least 5-10 occurrences\n",
    "- As n increases, most n-grams appear only once or never\n",
    "- This violates statistical reliability requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Bigram \"the dog\": Might appear 1000 times ✓\n",
    "- 5-gram \"the dog ran through\": Might appear 2 times ✗\n",
    "- 10-gram: Probably appears 0 times ✗✗\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "Large n means:\n",
    "- Model memorizes exact training sequences\n",
    "- No generalization to new contexts\n",
    "- Poor performance on test data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** It's like memorizing entire sentences vs. learning grammar rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Diminishing Returns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Research shows that **n=5 is typically the practical limit**:\n",
    "- n=2,3: Good balance of context and generalization\n",
    "- n=4,5: Marginal improvements\n",
    "- n>5: Minimal benefit, huge cost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "- Language has long-range dependencies\n",
    "- But most local dependencies captured by n=3-5\n",
    "- Longer contexts need different approaches (neural models)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of increasing n indefinitely:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Smoothing**: Handle unseen n-grams better (Add-k, Kneser-Ney)\n",
    "2. **Backoff**: Fall back to lower-order n-grams when higher-order unavailable\n",
    "3. **Interpolation**: Combine multiple n-gram orders\n",
    "4. **Neural Language Models**: Use RNNs, Transformers for unlimited context\n",
    "5. **Skip-grams**: Capture non-adjacent dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimal n depends on:**\n",
    "- ✓ Training data size (more data → can use larger n)\n",
    "- ✓ Domain complexity (technical text → larger n helpful)\n",
    "- ✓ Available resources (memory, compute)\n",
    "- ✓ Task requirements (generation vs. classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical practice:**\n",
    "- **Bigrams (n=2)**: Fast, robust, good baseline\n",
    "- **Trigrams (n=3)**: Best trade-off for most tasks\n",
    "- **4-grams/5-grams**: When you have massive data (e.g., Google n-grams)\n",
    "- **n>5**: Use neural models instead!"

    "**What do these metrics tell us?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: Overall percentage of correct predictions\n",
    "   - Good for balanced datasets\n",
    "   - Can be misleading for imbalanced classes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision**: Of all predicted positives, how many were actually positive?\n",
    "   - Important when false positives are costly\n",
    "   - Formula: TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recall**: Of all actual positives, how many did we catch?\n",
    "   - Important when false negatives are costly\n",
    "   - Formula: TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall\n",
    "   - Balanced metric\n",
    "   - Formula: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why might this model work?**\n",
    "- Positive reviews contain words like: \"great\", \"love\", \"amazing\", \"excellent\"\n",
    "- Negative reviews contain words like: \"terrible\", \"awful\", \"bad\", \"worst\"\n",
    "- N-gram patterns capture these sentiment-bearing phrases"
