    "    Stopwords are common words in a language that usually do not carry meaningful information in textual data analysis. However, the \"meaningfulness\" of these words depends on the context of the text. Generally, conjunctions and prepositions used in every language are statistically insignificant in many natural language processing applications. For instance, a search engine should not assign the same weight to conjunctions and prepositions as it does to other words that determine the actual intent of a query. In frequency analysis, the frequency of words like \"and\", \"to\", and \"from\" is not of particular interest and should be removed prior to the analysis.\n",

    "<div> Following normalization and the removal of low-value stopwords, we proceed with word frequency analysis on the comments associated with each poet's poem pages. This step helps uncover the most commonly used meaningful words within the user-generated content. <br/><br/> In the code snippet provided below, the comments are first grouped by poet, and then tokenized word lists are analyzed using the <code>FreqDist</code> class from the <code>nltk</code> library. This class efficiently computes word frequencies. For each poet, the top 25 most frequently occurring words are extracted, providing insight into recurring themes, vocabulary, or linguistic patterns. <br/><br/> The results are presented in a structured DataFrame that lists the most frequent words for each poet, serving as a useful tool for comparative analysis and thematic exploration. </div>"
